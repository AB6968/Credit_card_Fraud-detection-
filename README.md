# Credit_card_Fraud-detection-
In this project, my purpose  was to predict whether a credit card transaction is fraud or not so that the customers of credit card companies are not charged for items that they did not purchase. I did this project in Python.I have taken the dataset from kaggle which is having imbalanced data ,so I done sampling on that data to make it balanced.
